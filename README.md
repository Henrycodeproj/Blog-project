# Blog-project

The code is curently poorly organized and I will work on modularizing and cleaning up this code base.\

**Goal**: I wanted to create my own full stack project where people can make accounts and have a platform to discuss about board games.

**Description**:
This is my first fullstack project, it uses Bootstrap, Flask with Python backend, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and MySQL.
This is my localhost files and will need to be adjusted as so.
It is hosted on pythonanywhere at **https://boredblogs.pythonanywhere.com/** and is back online. I have removed some bulk libraries that weren't necessary for such a small project and is now accessible once again.
