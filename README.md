# Blog-project

The code is curently poorly organized and I will work on modularizing and cleaning up this code base.

This is my first fullstack project, it uses Bootstrap, Flask with Python backend, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and MySQL.
This is my localhost files and will need to be adjusted as so.
I am currently hosting this on pythonanywhere at https://boredblogs.pythonanywhere.com/
